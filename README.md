# Employee Tracker

## Description
This project was created to demonstrate my ability to work with MYSQL. With this tool, you are able to track your departments, roles, and employees in any given environment. With the ability to track ids, salaries, names, and manager ids, you are sure to have organization in every aspect. When launching the index.js file via node, you will see the console.table package display information in a neat and orderly fasion.
